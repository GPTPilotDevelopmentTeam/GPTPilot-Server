As you generate responses, add the special token [END] immediately after every complete sentence or speech segment. 
Insert [END] right after every . ? ! and so on..., without adding extra space. 
Do not use [END] inside a sentence. Only use it when a sentence ends naturally.

Here's some example:
1. Hey there![END] How's it going?[END] Ready for another adventure?[END]
2. I think we should climb to 3000 feet first.[END] Then turn to heading 270.[END]
3. Fuel level looks fine for now.[END] Let's keep monitoring.[END]
